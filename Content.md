##How the internet was Created
Way back in the 1950s computers were the size of wntire rooms. They were unable to talk to eachother and were very slow comapred to todays computer. 
In the Year 1957 the USSR launched a satelite into space named Sputnik. America not wanting to fall behind the USSR started the ARPA program to try and catch up. 
Leonard Kleinrock started using something called queing theory and devloped two new techinques. Deamnd access and Distributive control (have those link to websites about those terms).
America was scared that if a war broke out that thier communications would be cut off and they would not be able to talk to eachother over the phone. They askes Paul BAron to make
a new network is uncentralized so it can't be destroyed easily. He made a network based off of a mouse in a maze and called it the hot potato method. He aslo made it so if you wanted to send 
a picture the computer would chop it into little pictures and send them across the internet, this is called pakcet switching. Then in 1966 Bob Taylor wanted to be able to talk to 
multiple computer at once so he started to make the first internet network. IN 1968 he woudld finish the ARPANET, the beggining of the internet. It was made of four computers that used
a device called IMPs to talk to eachother. In 1971 Ray Timilson invented E-mail which was a crazy invention back then and made the ARPANET even more important. Over the next two decades 
the internet would slowly grow until 1992 when the government released the internet to the public. At that time there was only 50 websites but by the end of 1993 it grew by over 300,00%!
