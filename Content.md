## How the internet was Created

Way back in the 1950s computers were the size of entire rooms. They were unable to talk to each other and were very slow compared to today's computer. 
In the Year 1957 the USSR launched a satellite into space named Sputnik. America, not wanting to fall behind the USSR, started the ARPA program to try and catch up. 
Leonard Kleinrock started using something called queuing theory and developed two new techniques. Demand access and Distributive control (have those links to websites about those terms).
America was scared that if a war broke out that their communications would be cut off and they would not be able to talk to each other over the phone. They askes Paul BAron to make
a new network is uncentralized so it can't be destroyed easily. He made a network based off of a mouse in a maze and called it the hot potato method. He also made it so if you wanted to send 
a picture the computer would chop it into little pictures and send them across the internet, this is called packet switching. Then in 1966 Bob Taylor wanted to be able to talk to 
multiple computers at once so he started to make the first internet network. IN 1968 he would finish the ARPANET, the beginning of the internet. It was made of four computers that used
a device called IMPs to talk to each other. In 1971 Ray Timilson invented Email which was a crazy invention back then and made the ARPANET even more important. Over the next two decades 
the internet would slowly grow until 1992 when the government released the internet to the public. At that time there were only 50 websites but by the end of 1993 it grew by over 300,00%!

## The History of Yahoo 

In the year 1994 two college students would create Yahoo. They were trying to find information about sports players and realized how hard it was to navigate the internet. 
They thought they could make it easier for people so they hand sorted websites into different categories. Yahoo was an instant success in terms of usage. The main problem for Yahoo was that they did not know how to make money. Eventually the next year,1995, they decided to put ads on the website in order to make money. Yahoo's rival company Excite claimed they had a better way to sort websites than Yahoo did. They had the computer sort the websites for them. In 1997 both Yahoo and Excite started to become websites that people stayed at and used for more than searching things up. The reason for this was Yahoo wanted people to stay on their website longer so they would see more ads so yahoo can make more money. Because of this Yahoo was not good at being a search engine any more. In 1998 Google would launch focusing more on being any actual search engine and become more popular than Yahoo. 

## History of Google

In 1998 Google was launched by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They wanted to make a search engine that was actually good. Since Yahoo and Excite lost sight of that. They came up with the method to the numbers of links that existed for a website. The more links then the better the website must be and the higher it would appear on Google. They went to Excite and tried to sell them their idea but Excite didn't want to buy. So, Google made their own website. They wanted to find a new way to make money besides showing ads because they felt that it made the website look bad. They copied an idea that Bill Gross had to have companies pay to have their name appear higher on the search results. Because Google stole Bill's idea he would eventually sue and Google had to pay him money. Google would then go on to rapidly grow and when it went on the stock market it boomed making it the fastest growing company.

## History of Amazon

In 1995 Amazon was launched by Jeff Bezos in his garage. The original intent of the website was to sell books. Jeff  made Amazon grow at a breakneck rate saying "Get big fast". He prioritized making the company bigger rather than growing profit. In 1997 there was a new method that made the internet more secure so people began buying stuff on the internet at a rapid pace. Also that year Amazon went on Wall Street and grew rapidly. Many other people wanted to try and be like Amazon and started their own companies. This would eventually lead to an economic recession and a lot of businesses went bankrupt but Amazon survived. This led to Amazon continuing to grow rapidly and become the giant it is today.

## History of Napster
In 1999 Napster was launched by Shawn Fanning. He wanted to make a place where people could easily share music and talk about it. This would become the first web community a precursor for today's social media. The band Metallica got mad at Napster saying this violated copyright laws and they were essentially stealing the music. For the next fews years Napster's popularity skyrocketed. In 2001 Napster was officially sued and was forced to shut down. However, the impression that it left on the industry was not lost. Apple would later launch Itunes following in Napster's footsteps except more legal. MySpace was also soon launch building off the social media aspect of Napster
